## Description
Horiseon's previous code base for their website did not meet accessibilty standards. For instance if someone was to interact with their website using a screen reader, images would not have a descriptive caption. 

Now when examining Horiseons website's html and css you will see semantic elements, improving the accessibility of Horiseon's website, as well as optimizing its compatibility with search engines. The accompanying .css style guide was also updated with new class tags and semantic elements to consolidate code. Other small changes include giving the website an appropriiate title and fixing a broken navigation link.
